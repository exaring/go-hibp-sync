# go-hibp-sync

`go-hibp-sync` provides functionality to keep a local copy of the HIBP leaked password database in sync with the upstream version at https://haveibeenpowned.com.
In addition to syncing the database, the library allows exporting it into a single list â€” the former distribution format of the database.
